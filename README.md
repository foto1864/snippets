# File Converter

Essentially my first job as a web developer required me to have to convert
files to different formats all the time (i.e. pdf to jpg etc.). The way I 
would do this is I would go to various online converters and try their free
versions, just so that I could get my job done. However, even the free ones
would not let me convert indefinitely for free. Hence, I started creating my
own converter. 

## Technical Details

The project is built using react, and it is also integrated into the web 
at the address https://snippets.militos.org. 

Some conversions are not yet supported as tool has got as far as one can without
using any backend service like firebase etc.

I plan on enhancing the tool at some point in order to have a totally free
converter that I (and anyone else) can use.

## Disclaimer

The appearence of the tool is almost identical to free-converter.com, which is
a tool I very much like, and also use all the time, as it actually supports many 
more operations that my tool.
